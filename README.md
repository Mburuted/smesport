# Book description:

Business organizations are highly successful at delivering 'business as usual'; the day-to-day tasks of managing customer transactions, marketing and production activities, and motivating employees. But there is a growing requirement for such organizations also to deliver business change projects successfully. Tim Carroll's book provides an authoritative guide to improving project delivery in such organizations by: ¢ building a project management capability and culture that is appropriate to BAU organizations; ¢ aligning projects more closely with the strategic agenda of the organization, through the use of programmes; ¢ using portfolio management to improve this alignment and ensure the effectiveness of project investments; ¢ demonstrating the business context for projects and their contribution to the organization's agenda of strategic change.

## Reviews:
Sometimes a book comes along that completely takes you by surprise. Instead of the usual rehash of project management under the guise of progress, Project Delivery in Business as Usual Organisations by Tim Carroll delivers something genuinely new. This clear, well written and thought-provoking book provides not only a perspective on why project management has failed to evolve in some organisations but also a structured discussion about the potential practical solutions that can be applied.
